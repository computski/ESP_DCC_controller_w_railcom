/*debug notes
* we see bytes if JP1 is in place.  if JP1 is removed, the bytes stop.
* Its probable that noise will exist during the RC cutout that serial will interpret as data
* There is no way to flush/reset the receive buffer in Arduino other than to read all data.   There are supposedly datagrams in the railcom protocol
* so we should be able to extract valid data from what might appear to be an async stream of random stuff.
*
*
* DCCpacket.railcomCutoutActive is a flag generated by DCClayer1, it is true during the railcom cutout and so allows the main routine to 'gate' the serial data
* against the loco who's packet we are processing.  We need to be aware of when we update DCCpacket with new data vs when we read the serial port.
*
*
* Rules
* we can read/write to an address that may not even be in the roster.  for this reason we don't index LOCO
* if reading from a non roster loco, the only way we will see rc data from that loco is to keep sending it POM read packets for 0.5sec, because the regular loco packets won't
* every transmit to the target loco address
* we timeout after 80 packets, this is approx 0.5s
*
* 
* it appears we read the cv twice, possibly because we send 4 dcc-read-pom commands so normally you'd initiate read, expect a value, return that over a WS but 
* there might be a second repeat value come over, and you want to decode it, but also ignore it.... or is it sufficient to just enable 'look for id0?'
* we seem to have fixed the weird problem i saw before where reading a new cv generates the value of the prior cv read.
* 
* Bugs 2024-11-17.  cannot read cv5. we see ok over WS, but then nothing, no timeout, no WS messages.  on the line we can see the decder responds with
* AAAC which is valid, but still we see no response.  expected value is 64d
* I found that if I reversed the track polarity, I can reliably read cv5.   This is confusing because I could see it on the PicoScope but perhaps its just enough
* out of spec that the system cannot read it.  But this does not explain why it hangs and never sends a WS response.
* 
* wierd with the L298, the ESU cv8 consistently reads as 134 (wrong) or, if polarity is reversed it reads 151 (correct).  The PICO scope correctly decodes as A969
* but the ESP must be reading it differently.  but how?  the edges look about the same, and its consistently reading two 4/8 codes to get 134.
*
