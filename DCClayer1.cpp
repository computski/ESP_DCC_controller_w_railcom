/*DCClayer1 puts a DCC signal on the track.  It will continuously write the DCCbuffer to the track
The routine also sets a msTickFlag every 10mS which the main loop can use for general timing such as
keyboard scans.  It also generates a Railcom Cutout and looks for inbound Railcom data.

Note: using non PWM compat mode, the timebase is 200nS.

CAUTION: you cannot write consecutively to w1ts or w1tc, as the second write seems to null the first.
Instead you should OR the bits together e.g. gpio->w1ts = this | that

rtc_reg_write decprecated warning...TIMER_REG_WRITE
https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/blob/master/tools/sdk/include/eagle_soc.h

2024-12-07 added railcom decode functionality

2025-02-05 PIN_RAILCOM_SYNC_TOTEM defines a pin which supports the railcom sync signal as a totem pole output
PIN_RAILCOM_SYNC_TOTEM defines a pin which supports railcom sync active low, but otherwise acts as an WPU input and detects a switch as active low

The hardware (blue PCB) needs a mod using a 2k2 resistor to pull the D8 pin (PIN_RAILCOM_SYNC_TOTEM) to ground.  This is because the ESP module 12k pulldown resistor is
insufficient to pull down against the WPU in the 6N137 Opto, and this causes boot to fail as the pin must be low at boot.  2k2 directly to ground fixes this, but it does require
an active totem drive to overcome this 2k2.

If we want to use the pin as PIN_RAILCOM_SYNC_INPUT then we will need to have D8 drive a 2k2 base resistor into a NPN which will pull the Opto enable pin to ground.  We then drive
D8 with inverse logic, i.e. it is high during the railcom blanking period, and low during the railcom cutout.  It become a WPD (12k) input at DCC_CUTOUT_END when it is read and
DCCpacket.pinSyncInputTriggered is set if we see active hi, and must be cleared in some other processing routine.
The pushbutton must pull D8 to 3v3 via a 680R resistor.  This is because D8 is active low during the railcom cutout.

/*Interrupt handler for DCC
  for a dcc_zero or dcc_one the reload periods are different.  We queue up the next-bit in the second half of the bit currently being transmitted
  Some jitter is inevitable with maskable Ints, but it does not cause any problems with decooding in the locos at present.
  The handler will work its way through the TXbuffer transmitting each byte.  when it reaches the end, it sets the byte pointer to zero
  and sets the bitcounter to 22 indicating a preamble.  at this point it clears the DCCclearToSend flag to lock the DCCpacket buffer from writes for the next
  12 preamble bits this is so that the main prog loop routines have long enough to finish writing to the DCCpacket  if they had just missed the flag clearing.
  Once preamble is transmitted, the handler will copy the DCCpacket to the transmit buffer and set the DCCclearToSend flag indicating it is able to accept
  a new packet.  If the DDCpacket is not modified by the main loop, this layer 1 handler will continuously transmit the same packet to line.  This is useful
  as it allows an idle to be continuously transmitted when we are in Service Mode for example.

2023-08-30 modified to add a railcom cutout at end of packet.  Set doCutout when passing the DCCpacket to the routine.
The NRMA spec calls for a cutout after every loco (and accessory) packet sent.  The exception is during service mode.
In theory a loco will recognise packets sent to it, and it will respond during the cutout.  This avoids all locos trying to assert on the same cutout.

In theory, a cutout always starts after the 2nd half of a bit period and this is always a logic 0.  There is a transition to 'high' for Tcs
after which the cutout asserts.  The cutout ends with a logic 0 which is a psudeo end to an imaginary bit.  In any event the next bit start will be a logic 1.

The cutout start bit is asymetric, i.e. it has no complementary low-start bit of equal length.
